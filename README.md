# Notes on practice

## 9/12/20

### Warmup

#### Added: Slurring

2-octaves alternating up bow and down bow, 1st position. G major because it's easy and _right there_. Goal is to be smooth and even through the whole bow - especially the crossings - and to not get surprised by running out of bow.

After about a week it's noticeably improved - definitely some low hanging fruit there. The next level will be harder.

I plan to extend this to other scales (soonish) and positions (not so soon).

#### Single string octaves

I feel like I've made some progress relaxing the left hand on these - the shifts are landing a bit more smoothly now. Definitely more to go.

#### For future - add more different bowings - see Wohlfahrt intro for ideas.

### Etudes

#### Essential Elements Advanced Technique (book 4).

Through the basic shifting exercises - working on the "shifting repertoire" - little snippets of "real" music curated to help with shifting. We'll see.

#### Wohlfahrt #25

My teacher pushed me off of #24 pretty rapidly - I didn't really feel like I'd gotten much traction on it - an on to #25.

I do like this one though. It's the first of the Wohlfahrt that seems like music rather than purely technique building toil. It's written in 3/4 with 3 groups of 16th notes per measure, with the first 16th accented and forming a melody line with the remaining 3 16ths forming a kind of continuing backup or alternate melody. It reminds me of Philip Glass a bit. I'm sure there's proper musical theoritic terminology for this style, but IDK what it is - but I do like it.

For the most part it's not too hard to play - my struggles are that I keep speeding up, so I'll be breaking out the 'nome to help with that. And there are a few bits of fingering that are hard - like, F5# -> A4 (on D string). Slow down and play deliberately is my thought ... I just haven't done it yet.

### Repertoire

#### Suzuki / book 4 #1 – Seitz Concerto #2, 3rd Movement.

Progress on first 2 sections (first page) - haven't really started 2nd page yet.

My teacher is encouraging me to come off the strings in the first D-G and B-D bits for flair - which is harder than it seems, especially as I keep trying to speed it up. Slow down.

It also raises a general question about my playing - which is a kind of reluctance to make mistakes. Part of my nature, but, as a student, I have to be okay with making mistakes - it's a necessary part of learning. It's just so ... noticeable and loud with violin.

I have been pushing myself to play louder, but my teacher has framed it a "playing into the bow" - making sure to get the pressure and feel the flexion. Slow down more. I'm not capturing his thoughts well, but it's helping.

## 9/5/20

### Warmup

#### Open strings

Goals are smooth bows – on long bows, there seems to be a certain range of motion where the bowing is bumpy and there’s a little audible tremor in the sound. Also, smooth crossings – I struggle with both a clean takeoff and a clean landing – so I go slow and try to get them clean.

#### Tonalization and G-major arpeggios

Focus is on listening really carefully – and trying to land the note. I usually play with a tuner on but for this practice I close my eyes or look away to focus on what I hear. My teacher generally encourages playing with a tuner, but I wonder if it’s made my listening lazy?

#### Working on vibrato

Generally focus on A string, 3rd position – basically a D major scale – first 3 fingers are okay but 4th finger sucks – it’s just rigid. Relaxation seems to be the key.  I also get sidetracked on intonation and end up playing scales in 3rd position and forget to work on the vibrato.

#### Single string octaves

Up and down, moving through 1st, 3rd, and 5th position. Goals are to get the notes clear and in tune – which has definitely improved over time but is still tough, especially coming down in 5th position.  I usually hit the harmonic for the octave for reference, and tune against the 4th with the next lower string and the 5th with the next higher when possible. Also, smoothing out the shifting – the shifts are little earthquakes on the neck when I land. The key seems to be really really relaxing the hand.

### Etudes

#### Essential Elements Advanced Technique (book 4).

Working on shifting studies.

#### Wohlfahrt #24

The first challenge seems to be the groups of 16th notes. My teacher says they’re done with just the wrist, not the arm – and of course I’m struggling with that.

### Repertoire

#### Suzuki / book 4 #1 – Seitz Concerto #2, 3rd Movement.

I’ve been working on this for a month or so, mostly the first page. I’m doing the initial D&G in 3rd position and then shifting down – this really feels good, but landing the shift is often bumpy. My teacher has suggested working to come off the string on the up-bows, and it sounds nice, but landing for the next note is horrible right now. Also, this is in 6/8 and is really challenging my weak counting game.
